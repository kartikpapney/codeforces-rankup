Hi Everyone!!!
Are you struggling on Codeforces? Are you stucked at some rating? Do u wanna improve? If Yes, then I've a solution for you.

### When you struggle at CF?
One of the major reason of saturated rating on codeforces or any other coding platform is when you don't solve problems above your current level. Let's say I'm rated 1400 on codeforces then to improve my rating I should solve more problems with rating >= 1400. Now all these problems should be well hand picked.

### What type of problem you should solve?
You should sovle those problems whose difficulty level & topic has more positive impact on your current rating. A problem may be good for one but not for other. So the codeforces-rankup provides problems based on your curret rating skills.

Let's say you're rated 1500 at present and you're aiming for improving to 1600 in upcoming contests. Then you should solve all the problems solved at that profile which are rated >= 1500. You can continue this method for more than 1 profile if you want. For a better practice you can also select sub-topics(dp, constructive algorithms, bitmask). All of these functionality is provided at codeforces-rankup.

### Technologies Used
#### 1. React JS (Fronted Framework)
